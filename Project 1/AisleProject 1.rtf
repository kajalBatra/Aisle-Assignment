\f0\fs40 \cf0 The basic solution would have been cron job but as users are from different countries, so a cron will be too much resource consuming from server.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 Second and optimised approach will be to save timestamp for user\'92s last app access.\u8232 So whenever user launches the app or user gets Home Screen data, Home Screen API will check the current timestamp and last saved timestamp. If the date is same, api will return the likes from database else likes in database will be updated to 10 and returned to the user.\u8232 This approach will save much overhead and will only check for users who run the app on that day whereas cron will do for all the users.}
